# Optimizing Performance

Fugue provides comprehensive performance optimization strategies for production probabilistic programming workloads. This guide covers memory optimization, numerical stability, and efficient computation patterns.

## Memory-Optimized Inference

For high-throughput inference scenarios, memory allocation becomes the bottleneck. Fugue's memory optimization system solves this with object pooling:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/optimizing_performance.rs:memory_pooling}}
```

**Key Benefits:**

- Zero-allocation execution after warm-up
- Configurable pool size for memory control
- Automatic trace recycling and cleanup
- Built-in performance monitoring with hit ratios

## Numerical Stability

Probabilistic computations often involve extreme values that cause overflow or underflow. Use log-space operations for stability:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/optimizing_performance.rs:numerical_stability}}
```

**Stability Features:**

- `log_sum_exp` prevents overflow in mixture computations
- `weighted_log_sum_exp` for importance sampling
- `safe_ln` handles edge cases gracefully
- All operations maintain numerical precision across scales

## Efficient Trace Construction

When building traces programmatically, use `TraceBuilder` for optimal performance:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/optimizing_performance.rs:efficient_construction}}
```

**Construction Benefits:**

-   Pre-allocated data structures minimize reallocations
-   Type-specific insertion methods avoid boxing overhead
-   Batch operations for multiple choices
-   Efficient conversion to immutable traces

## Copy-on-Write for MCMC

MCMC algorithms frequently modify small portions of large traces. COW sharing optimizes memory usage:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/optimizing_performance.rs:cow_traces}}
```

**MCMC Optimizations:**

-   O(1) trace cloning until modification
-   Shared memory for unchanged parameters
-   Lazy copying only when traces diverge
-   Perfect for Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling

## Vectorized Model Patterns

Structure models for efficient batch processing:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/optimizing_performance.rs:optimized_patterns}}
```

**Vectorization Strategy:**

-   Pre-allocate data collections
-   Use `plate!` for independent parallel operations
-   Minimize dynamic allocations in hot paths
-   Leverage compiler optimizations with static sizing

## Performance Monitoring

Track and optimize inference performance systematically:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/optimizing_performance.rs:performance_monitoring}}
```

**Monitoring Approach:**

-   Collect trace characteristics for optimization insights
-   Track memory usage patterns
-   Validate numerical stability
-   Profile execution bottlenecks

## Batch Processing

Optimize throughput for multiple inference runs:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/optimizing_performance.rs:batch_processing}}
```

**Batch Benefits:**

-   Amortized setup costs across samples
-   Memory pool reuse for consistent performance
-   Scalable to large sample counts
-   Predictable memory footprint

## Numerical Precision Testing

Validate stability across different computational scales:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/optimizing_performance.rs:precision_testing}}
```

**Testing Strategy:**

-   Verify stability across extreme value ranges
-   Test edge cases and boundary conditions
-   Validate consistency of numerical operations
-   Profile precision vs. performance trade-offs

## Performance Testing

Implement systematic performance validation:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/optimizing_performance.rs:performance_testing}}
```

**Testing Framework:**

-   Memory pool efficiency validation
-   Numerical stability regression tests
-   Trace construction benchmarking
-   COW sharing verification

## Production Deployment

### Memory Configuration

-   Size `TracePool` based on peak concurrent inference
-   Monitor hit ratios to validate pool efficiency
-   Use COW traces for MCMC workloads
-   Pre-warm pools before production traffic

### Numerical Strategies

-   Always use log-space for probability computations
-   Validate extreme value handling in testing
-   Monitor for numerical instabilities in production
-   Use stable algorithms for critical computations

### Monitoring and Alerting

-   Track inference latency and memory usage
-   Monitor pool statistics and efficiency metrics
-   Alert on numerical instabilities or performance degradation
-   Profile hot paths for optimization opportunities

## Common Performance Patterns

1. **Pool First**: Use `TracePool` for any repeated inference
2. **Log Always**: Work in log-space for numerical stability
3. **Batch Everything**: Amortize costs across multiple samples
4. **Monitor Continuously**: Track performance metrics in production
5. **Test Extremes**: Validate stability with extreme values

These optimization strategies enable Fugue to handle production-scale probabilistic programming workloads with consistent performance and numerical reliability.
