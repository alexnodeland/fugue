## Tutorial Overview

### 🪙 [Bayesian Coin Flip](./bayesian-coin-flip.md)

**Foundation**: Statistical inference and model analysis

Your introduction to Bayesian reasoning through the classic coin flipping problem. This tutorial demonstrates how prior beliefs are updated with evidence to form posterior distributions.

**Key Concepts:**

- Prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions
- Bayesian updating with Beta-Binomial conjugacy
- Model validation and parameter estimation
- Analytical vs computational solutions

**What You'll Build:**

- Complete Bayesian coin bias estimation model
- Prior sensitivity analysis framework
- Model validation with synthetic data

```admonish info title="Prerequisites"

### 🔒 [Type Safety Features](./type-safety-features.md)

**Foundation**: Type-safe probabilistic programming

Explore Fugue's revolutionary type system that eliminates runtime errors while preserving full statistical expressiveness. Learn how dependent types make probabilistic programs both safer and faster.

**Key Concepts:**

- Natural return types for distributions (`bool`, `u64`, `f64`, `usize`)
- Compile-time safety guarantees
- Safe array indexing with categorical distributions
- Parameter validation at construction time
- Performance benefits through zero-cost abstractions

**What You'll Build:**

- Type-safe hierarchical models
- Safe array indexing examples
- Performance comparison with traditional PPLs

```admonish tip title="Why This Matters"
Traditional PPLs force everything through `f64`, leading to runtime casting and errors. Fugue's type system catches these issues at compile time.
```

### 🔍 [Trace Manipulation](./trace-manipulation.md)

**Foundation**: Runtime system and advanced inference

Master Fugue's execution trace system — the foundation that enables sophisticated inference algorithms. Learn how traces record, replay, and analyze probabilistic model executions.

**Key Concepts:**

- Trace system architecture and execution history
- Handler system for flexible model interpretation
- Replay mechanics for MCMC and inference algorithms
- Custom handlers for specialized inference strategies
- Memory optimization for production deployment
- Diagnostic tools for convergence assessment

**What You'll Build:**

- Custom MCMC algorithm using trace replay
- Specialized handlers for debugging models
- Production inference pipeline with memory optimization
- Comprehensive diagnostic system for model validation
